AWS SQS River Plugin for ElasticSearch
==================================

The AWS SQS plugin uses Amazon's SQS as a river by pulling messages from a given queue. Right after a message is indexed it gets deleted from the queue.

Messages are in the following JSON format:

    {
      "_id": "123",
      "_index": "es_index_name",
      "_type": "es_data_type",
      "_data": { "key1": "value1" ...}
    }

If `_data` is missing the data with this id will be deleted from the index.

If `_index` is missing it will fallback to the index that was initially configured, otherwise the `_index` property overrides the default configuration and allows you to dynamically switch between indexes.

The fields `_id` and `_type` are required.

Throttling is used when the queue starts to fill up. If the river keeps getting zero messages, it slows down the requests.

To configure put this in your `elasticsearch.yml`:

    cloud.aws.region: AWS REGION
    cloud.aws.access_key: AWS ACCESS KEY
    cloud.aws.secret_key: AWS SECRET KEY
    cloud.aws.sqs.queue_url: AWS QUEUE URL
    cloud.aws.throttling: (true by default)
    cloud.aws.debug: (false by default)

Or use river configuration:

    curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/_river/my_sqs_river/_meta' -d '{
      "type": "amazonsqs",
      "amazonsqs": {
          "region": "AWS REGION",
          "access_key": "AWS ACCESS KEY",
          "secret_key": "AWS SECRET KEY",
          "queue_url": "AWS QUEUE URL"
        },
        "index": {
          "max_messages": 10,
          "timeout_seconds": 10,
          "index": "es_index_name"
        }

    }'

In order to install the plugin, simply run: `bin/plugin -install aleski/elasticsearch-river-amazonsqs/1.2.1`.
